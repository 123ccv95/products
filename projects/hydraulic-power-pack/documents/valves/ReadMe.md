## Hydraulic Power Pack

# Control Valves

Mechanical or Solenoid Valves are used to control the action of the actuator. 

These can be mounted directly onto the manifold on the mounting plate:

For simple momentary action with automatic return (as with combined action clamping-injection) a 2 way Normally Closed valve can be used:

However, for full positional control of the actuator, double-acting 5 port 2 position valve is required.

For this application, the valve should be 'closed centre' (all ports blocked in central position).
