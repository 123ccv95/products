## Hydraulic Power Pack

# Control Valves

Mechanical or Solenoid Valves are used to control the action of the actuator. 

These can be mounted directly onto the manifold on the mounting plate:

For momentary action with automatic return (as with combined action clamping-injection) a 2 way Normally Closed valve is used:

For full postional control of the actuator, a 5 Way 2 Position valve is required.
