## PP 'Headquarter' tasks 

1. Could you place a very visible download button on the main page ? We had to hand the links out over 50 + times just in the last 6 weeks and you still didn't react ...
2. Can you place a big marketplace button visible on the main page ? Just like in any other website ? I understand you wanna boost your own economy but what about the community ? 
3. Could you please introduce fair market rules like anywhere else ? The top sellers row is obviously faked and abused in your and your buddies favor (I can demonstrate this with the original code of the bazar if you need). The featured vendor row is also non-sense : non of that guys really contributed, was here nor published designs,..., and worst one is making profit with a crucial shredder update everybody was waiting for. Also, running sales through the bazar makes only sense for items below 1000E, after that it's just too much trouble for many reasons as tax, price increase, internal tracking/CRM, invoicing,... You had 300K to maintain a stable team for many years, it's quite a offense you want to turn the community into your revenue stream because - as you often said your self - you can't deal with money. Also, imagine the consequences for the economy when rating agencies suddenly start faking data,... 
4. Could you please apply same policies as anywhere else for wiki content, maintaining neutrality ? Sad to see it's now getting an advertising board.
5. Could you please fix the academy pages ? I understand you wanna push your 'workspace' model but it makes only a small fraction of PP and I don't see any reason that you turn the specs into obstacles and confusion for others. 
6. Could you please create a directory page for PP, there is more than enough and important input, projects, content. It's just too excessive work to communicate this on a daily base.
7. Could you please put note about filament, also here we spent A LOT of time clarifying this claims for you - on a daily base, despite we're happy having new members in the F***club.
8. Having that said and considering that PP is quite more than just a cute pet project, could you please seek for professional expertise to run the project ? We'd really be happy that those issues are being taken serious, preferably on a full-time base. The adoption rate as well your response time to crucial issues is way off the normal and is really damaging the project and efforts.
9. Could you please rework the website and make it more simple just? Your workspace model and the new claim ´start a business´ which you also can´t back up with facts isn´t doing any good for the project either. Alone this claim created some work again, and nobody til today could actually point something out. That´s just dangerous telling people such things. We already pushed customers back because they wanted to take big loans. There is now also enough evidence that v3 is being favored by the community/users. Might make sense to focus then on that instead (fixes, extensions, completeness). For instance, the starterkits are nice for some people but I think nobody needs really a floor plan nor getting told to put flowers in the corner (poor flowers btw.) 
Thanks a lot, 
your plastic hub team, basically the ORG part of PP :slight_smile:
Btw, you can fix all that in a half day ! because if not, it´s again others who spent endless hours per year doing it for you. If you need extra funding to get this done, we're happy to pay too. The survival of ours and others little and fragile entrepreneurship depends on state of the art tools and policies.

10. Please put a normal forum back. Having no real place to work together is also just damaging the project, in top you're locking out seniors, non tech savy folks by targeting the young & inexperienced part of the population.  But obviously, we can't see any long term success that way either. It's already harsh to see the kind of life you're willing to live but please don't make it as narrative for the users or advertise the project that way in public. The overall success of PP relies on professional tools, management and users. Btw. there is a drastic chilling effect for innovation and progress by hiding communication behind proprietary tools; the average life time of a Discord message is below a day; nobody find this back nor can build on prio reports and articles anymore. That's a huge set back to the project as well.
